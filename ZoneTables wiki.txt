# ZoneTables
ZoneTables is a standalone support add-on that is used to dynamically create and/or update information, reference, and/or 
cross-reference tables for each and every one of the Zones and Subzones in the game world. Because it is a support add-on, it has 
been designed for use by developers rather than users.

ZoneTables supports information, reference, and cross-reference tables for both Zones and Subzones. The only difference between 
Zones and Subzones is that multiple Subzones can be nested within a Zone just as multiple Zones can be nested within a world Map 
(See the description and layout of the ZoneTree tables).

I mention this so you understand that anytime this wiki refers to a Zone, it can mean a Subzone as well. For example, while Zone 
Index values and Zone Identifier values are different for Zones and Subzones, their indexes and identifiers operate in exactly the 
same manner for Subzones as they do for Zones.

WARNING: You must be running ESO game code for the Wrathstone API (100026), or greater, for this add-on to function correctly.
## What It Is
Because the game does not guarantee that the ordinal table positions of Zone or Subzone table entries accessed by a "Zone Index" 
are static, the Zone or Subzone table entry that a Zone Index points to in this version may not be the same Zone or Subzone table 
entry that it pointed to in the previous version or that it will point to in the next version. This is the primary reason why hard 
coded Zone and Subzone tables are such a time-consuming pain to maintain.

To get around this problem, the game developers designed additional Zone and Subzone tables whose ordinal table positions are 
static values and named these indexes "Zone Identifiers"; however, identifiers are not the same as, and do not interchange well 
with, Zone Indexes because identifiers differ from indexes in values, usage and purpose. Recently, the game developers provided 
sufficient information in the game API return values to make implementation of this add-on feasible.

ZoneTables uses game API functions to create and maintain sets of Zone and Subzone information, reference and cross-reference 
tables; thus, it eliminates the tedious and time-consuming manual updates required by hard coded Zone and Subzone tables. 
ZoneTables creates information, reference, and cross-reference tables for its Zone and Subzone maps dynamically every time:
* the game changes its APIVersion number
* ZoneTables changes its AddOnVersion number
* ZoneTables detects missing or empty Maps tables
* the game adds new or deletes old maps

Otherwise, ZoneTables retrieves the most current reference tables from its saved variables file and then scans and updates these reference table entries for missing tables and/or table entries and automatically reloads those tables and/or entries.

"Standalone" means that ZoneTables should not be embedded. Please load only one instance of ZoneTables from your ".../Addons/" directory and append a "##DependsOn: ZoneTables" directive in your add-on's manifest file to instruct the game to verify that a ZoneTables process exists and is running before the game loads your add-on.

Do NOT embed a ZoneTables folder within your add-on!
## What It Does
ZoneTables uses Map Indexes and Map Identifiers to access its reference tables just like the game does. In fact, most if not all of the ZoneTables indexes and identifiers use the same values the game does. The difference is that ZoneTables creates several index to identifier and identifier to index cross-reference tables that are not visible to the add-on developer in the game's version 100026 API functions.
* A Map Index is the ordinal position of an entry in a Maps reference or cross-reference table. Index values may change whenever the game's APIVersion changes. Indexes are often used to access specific maps when the game needs to place objects, markers, icons, and/or subdivisions (i.e. zones, subzones, etc.) at x,y location coordinates. "mapIndex" is the variable name ZoneTables uses most often and the name is often shortened to "inx" or "mdx".
* A Map Identifier is the ordinal position of an entry in a Maps reference or cross-reference table. Identifier values do not change whenever the game's APIVersion changes. Identifiers are often used to access map content like textures, icons, widgets, or .dds files to enable the graphics engine to "draw" them on your monitor (See [Texture List](https://wiki.esoui.com/Texture_List) in the ESOUI wiki). "mapId" is the variable name ZoneTables uses most often and the name is often shortened to "id" or "mid".

Although Map Indexes and Map Identifiers may appear to be interchangeable, they are not because their values, purpose and usage differ and because they reference different tables for different reasons; however, what indexes and identifiers have in common, for example, is where the Map Index (1) for the Tamriel map refers to map data points, the Map Identifer (27) for the Tamriel map refers to the textures, icons, and .dds files for the Tamriel map. Think of it this way: identifiers reference tables that tell the game "what to draw"; indexes reference tables that tell the game "where to draw" them.

ZoneTables determines when to create its reference tables or when to update an existing set of reference tables based on these criteria; if a Saved Variables file (i.e. .../SavedVariables/LibMaps.lua) exists that contains ZoneTables reference and/or cross-reference tables information for this NA, EU, or PTS megaserver, then the tables in that Saved Variables file will be used unless...
1. The value returned from the GetAPIVersion() API function is not equal to the APIVersion value in the Saved Variables file; then, ZoneTables will create a new set of reference and/or cross-reference tables for every Map index the game returns to it.
2. The addonVersion value in the ZoneTables control entry (See the [AddonStub](https://github.com/Drakanwulf/AddonStub/wiki) wiki) is greater than the AddOnVersion value in the Saved Variables file; then, ZoneTables will create a new set of reference and/or cross-reference tables for every Map index the game returns to it.
3. The value returned from the GetNumMaps() API function is not equal to the numMaps value in the Saved Variables file; then, ZoneTables will create a new set of reference and/or cross-reference tables for every Map index the game returns to it.
4. Any reference or cross-reference table in the Saved Variables file is missing or is empty; then, ZoneTables will create a new set of reference and/or cross-reference tables for every Map index the game returns to it.

ZoneTables uses game API functions to automatically create and maintain reference and/or cross-reference tables for each and every Map in the game:
* It creates new or updates existing reference table entries by iterating through every Map index (e.g. 1 (Tamriel) through the current maximum number of Maps in the game (See the game GetNumMaps() API function).
* It creates new or updates existing reference tables for which the game API functions return information that the ZoneTables API functions require.
* It creates Information and Location reference tables for every Map.
* It creates Map Name to Map Index reference tables.
* It creates a Map Index to Zone Identifier cross-reference table.
* It creates Map Identifier to Map Name and Map Name to Map Identifier reference tables that the game API does not provide currently (as of 100026).
* It creates Map Index to Map Identifier and Map Identifier to Map Index cross-reference tables that the game does not provide currently (as of 100026).
## What It Needs
* ZoneTables uses the AddonStub support add-on to return an existing (i.e. duplicate) control entry or to create a control entry on ZoneTables' behalf.  Because ZoneTables is a standalone support add-on, its default actions have been coded to fail all older or duplicate versions of itself so these duplicates cannot continue to execute.
* ZoneTables needs the LibGPS2 library add-on and its dependent library add-ons (e.g. LibStub, LibMapPing, LibAddOnMenu-2.0, etc.) to generate and return global x, y location coordinates for the top left corner of each map according to its relative position within (or outside of) the Tamriel map.
## History:
ZoneTables has no ancestors. It is the result of our examining hard coded table data and the cooperation and assistance we received from other add-on authors who support the game. We would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their kindness and their efforts to assist us.
## API Functions:
ZoneTables does not duplicate existing game API functions like:
* Game API functions that use Map Indexes
    * GetCyrodiilMapIndex()
    * GetImperialCityMapIndex()
    * GetMapNameByIndex(*luaindex* _mapIndex_)
    * GetAutoMapNavigationCommonZoomOutMapIndex()
    * SetMapToMapListIndex(*luaindex* _index_) 
* Game API functions that use Map Identifiers
    * GetMapNumTilesForMapId(*integer* _mapId_)
    * GetMapTileTextureForMapId(*integer* _mapId_, *luaindex* _tileIndex_)
* Game API functions for retrieving Map identifiers, indexes, and names from the current Map
    * GetCurrentMapId()
    * GetCurrentMapIndex()
    * GetMapName()

ZoneTables uses the SetMapToMapListIndex(*luaindex* _index_) game API function to iterate through the game's list of active Maps.

Because the game handles the "Tamriel" and "The Aurbis" maps differently than it does other maps, it is possible for the ZoneTables API functions to return nil or zero (0) values because the corresponding Map values do not exist or they default to zero (invalid) values; however, please remember that 0,0 are valid defaults for the x,y location GPS coordinates of the top left corner of any Map. For those reasons, I believe you will find that some cross-reference tables are missing entries for indexes (1) and (24) (i.e. the Maps indexes for the "Tamriel" and "The Aurbis" maps).
